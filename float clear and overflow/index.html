        Before the universe came to be, there was a singular presence: an
        ancient consciousness, the Primordial Mind, an infinite intelligence who
        could think inscrutable thoughts that no mind of the past, present, and
        future can hope to penetrate. In the moment when the universe was
        created, this mind was shattered into many fragments. Although all of
        these parts shared the same progenitor, these mental fragments soon
        gained individuality. Two among its greater fragmentsâ€”Radinthul and
        Diruulth--fought each other and twisted all of creation with their
        powers of enthrallment to serve their conflict. In this cascade of
        moments, a third greater fragment, the unsung Ancient, made itself
        known. This intellect named itself Zet and strived to stop the appalling
        disharmony that it had just witnessed in the first moments of its
        conception. Focusing all of its power, Zet overwhelmed both of its
        siblings and fused them into a single form, trapping them both in an
        inert crystalline sphere. Zet hurled this sphere into the darkness of
        space to be adrift for eternity until the gravitational force of a
        burgeoning planet captured this body and turned it into its satellite.
        The cost of this imprisonment drained most of its strength, but Zet was
        determined to use its remaining power to sentence itself into an eternal
        vigil. Time passes by and the once nondescript world became teeming with
        primitive lifeforms that rose into significance and then fell into
        naught but apocrypha. But in each generation of this life cycle, none
        could escape the glare of this eerie celestial body (which they soon
        named "The Mad Moon" in their lore) that appeared at all times of the
        day.[1] Meanwhile, the warring Ancients resolved to escape their prison
        using the reverberations of their clash, tidal forces, and the orbital
        stress acting between the planet and their prison.[2] Zet used its
        weakened powers to contain the breach, but on one fateful night, the Mad
        Moon was shattered and the resulting explosion expelled moonstuff at
        high velocity towards the planet and destroyed its surface in an
        extinction event.The Ancients were freed, but they returned in a new
        form that they stole from the very material that made up their prison.
        As for Zet, it was flung to the farthest reaches of space and warped by
        the dissonant energies of his siblings. No longer of single form or
        thought, Zet embodied the very concept that Zet despises the most:
        disharmony. They were disunited into many parts, a fractured
        consciousness much like its progenitor. Using the remaining power that
        they had left, Zet struggled to reunite their separated elements into a
        single goal and travelled the cosmos to rejoin the fray against the
        Ancients who had resumed their war. The Sundered Moon Zet was among the
        many heroes who were gathered in the Sundered Moon bar. Unlike the other
        heroes socializing with each other, Zet sat alone in the corner of the
        pub as if the Self was waiting for someone. Overhearing a conversation
        between a certain amorous god and his unlucky prey, the Self provoked
        the former to get his attention, calling him a half-god. The vexed "half
        god" left his potential lover and confronted this strange hooded figure
        by himself. Zet taunts the deity with its superior origins, but Zeus
        retorts with quips on its lack of pronouns and poor enunciation. Adding
        to his words, he took the Self's taunts as an invitation to a fight. The
        Self declares him half correct, saying that Self only came here to
        fight. Annoyed with this meaningless ebb and flow of talk, Zeus reminded
        the stranger about why they were all gathered here, telling the Self
        that anyone it picks a fight with in this bar will tear down an Ancient
        the next day. Undaunted by his boldness, Zet corrects the half-god by
        saying that the Self will not destroy one Ancient, but both of them. Zet
        revealed a projection of the lore about the two ancient intellects from
        the "world before your world", Radinthul and Diruulth. It told the story
        of their battle, imprisonment, and escape. Zet reveals to him that the
        Ancients have been building an army of lesser creatures to serve their
        conflict, and if either Ancient were to win, their power would end "both
        of their worlds". Such a grand task could not be done alone, and like
        its Ancient siblings, it seeks to amass an army aligned against both
        Ancients. Zet handed him a scroll and told him to fulfill whatever
        mystery was inside it. Unsure of whatever nonsense that Zet had just
        talked about, Zeus asked the Self if he had any stake in this war. Zet
        promised him that the Self would "make him whole again" should they be
        successful in the destruction of both Ancients. Still having doubts with
        the Self's offer, Zeus asked him to verify this claim by giving him a
        "taste of this wholeness". The Self agreed and returned to him a small
        fragment of his rightful power, including a golden helm rimming with
        divine power. Satisfied, Zeus relished in his newfound power, completely
        ignoring the nonsense that led to this moment. He invites the Self to
        hear about his divorce story while offering it some ambrosia. The Self
        politely declines because it has work to do, before revealing six other
        scrolls like the one it gave to Zeus.[3]
